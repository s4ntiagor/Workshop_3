# Welcome!
Welcome to the Machine Learning Data Streaming Code Challenge. This project utilis an exercise that uses Apache Kafka to predict happiness scores across various countries using a regression machine learning model. We will work with a dataset comprised of 5 CSV files containing country-specific information. The entire workflow encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes on the 5 CSV files, which include transformations, feature selection, splitting the data 70-30 for training, streaming the transformed data, making predictions, and storing the predictions in a database. We will employ the following tools to complete this project:
